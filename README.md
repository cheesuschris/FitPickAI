# FitPickAI

WardrobeAI is a full-stack web application that helps users organize their virtual wardrobe and automatically generates a **daily outfit of the day (OOTD)**. Users can upload their clothes, mark availability (e.g., laundry), and get personalized outfit suggestions displayed on an avatar.  

Built with **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and Vercel**, this project demonstrates modern full-stack web development, cloud deployment, and UX-focused product design.
